 airpods battery viewer for Windows 10

## Requirements 
- Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) or higher(tested on Windows 10, version 18362.720)
- Bluetooth 4.0+ (tested and developed on Dell AC1560 and Intel AX200(music stutters occur occasionally, no current fix))
## References 
- Inspiration from Android project:<https://github.com/adolfintel/OpenPods>
- Using Python library "Bleak":<https://github.com/hbldh/bleak> and "pybluez"
## Todo
- model display(gen1,gen2,pro)
- charging status display
- improve icon in app and tray, unify styles.
- language localization(if needed)
## Longterm
- rewrite the whole app in c++ or c#(I doubt if this could improve overall performance, as latency mainly occurs in device detection)
## Known bugs
## Known Issues
- huge packing size(exe)
